Suppose that you're a Yu-Gi-Oh! player who runs an Agent Fairy deck. (I understand that you may not be familiar with Yu-Gi-Oh!, and that's okay. Combo Chance works with all kinds of TCGs.)

In Agent Fairies, opening with [Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen](http://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=7573) and [Archlord Kristya](http://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=8283) is awesome. This combo locks down Special Summons and will surely bait out removal. But how often will this happen? Find out using Combo Chance!

Let's say that your deck has 3 Valhallas and 3 Kristyas. To perform this combo, you'll only need one of each (but more is okay). Also, your deck has 40 cards in total, and the opening hand size in Yu-Gi-Oh! is 5 cards. Simply fill out that information, press "Compute", and voila:

According to Combo Chance, you will open Valhalla + Kristya about once in every 10 duels.

So, got a combo in mind? [Give it a try!](http://combochance.sudicode.com)
